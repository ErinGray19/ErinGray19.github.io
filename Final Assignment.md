<h3> <center> Be Presentable </center></h3>
<h4> <center>This Blog Post will be on what I've done for Assignment 6  </center> </h4>

- Here's a link to our <strong> [Awesome Presentation](https://assignment3-eringray19.c9users.io/newassignment6/index.html#/) </strong><br>

#### **Reflections**

* Team BlueBlueGreen was back at it again! This time Brynna took the reins for 
downloading the base repository and making Amanda and I collaborators. 
We were able to easily create our slides and decided as a team to not include a lot of words and lists but primarily use pictures.

* We decided to follow Brynna's lead from her community event and do our presentation on `Machine Learning` and `Neural Networks`. 

##### *As a team:*
* After we noticed the lovely picture you drew depciting the funnel shape for how to arrange your presentation we decided to split up our research and our slides in 3 different parts

> `Amanda` worked on the introduction and the Overview 

> `Erin` I worked on the specifics in the middle and focused my research on `Reinforcement Learning`

> `Brynna` worked on the Applications and some of the Daily Life aspects of Neural Networks

* We did our research individually and created our slide content and then came together to put them together and record our voice-overs for the slides.

*We ran into several challenges that we were able to work together to overcome*

* At one point there was the audio being pulled from the repository that we'd just cloned from, and we had to work several different steps in order to make sure it didn't return.


*And there was a few challenges that I couldn't overcome*

* I tried really hard to upload a video clip from youtube to my presentation, but after several different attempts, I unfortunately wasn't able to find a way to complete this.

> Here's the clip I wanted to include

*Any lightbulbs that came on for you*

* Honestly I think one of my favorite parts of this assignment was the scripting. It seemed to run the smoothest out of the things that we were able to accomplish and I will probably keep finding ways to work on that in the future!

* Also, at one point, I messed up our template and all of our backgrounds and fonts were messed up, but after freaking out `for only a second` I remembered I could revert back to spot where the template wasn't screwed up, and it saved my bacon!


#### Skills and attitudes for this project

* As I mentioned before, I'm enjoying scripting a lot, and `Pandoc` I think has been a team `BlueBlueGreen` favorite, as Amanda's already using it outside of the classroom!

* Also, I enjoy that we can pull things from earlier in the class, like `git revert` and `pandoc`  

* This class has also really taught me a lot about teamwork, Obviously I've worked with teams before, but never have I seen such an equal and fair doling out of tasks than with `BlueBlueGreen`

* This assignment was again a lesson in patience for me. I know I might get a little frustrated at times, but I also am able to step back and notice that I'm still learning.

* Each time we complete an assignment I can look back at my work before and see the progress I've made, and while frustrating, I'm extremely proud of how far I've come.

* When I started this class I was completely intimidated and to now be able to look at scripts and work the command line like I know `mostly` what I'm doing, makes me feel like I've grown leaps and bounds from where I was.

#### Using Skills Beyond this class
* I have no doubt I will use these skills after I leave this class

* It is partially due to this class `and the urging of my advisors` that I will be following the Information Science track for the rest of my Graduate School Career!

* Next year I will be taking `Databases I` and I have no doubt that I will be using some of the information that I learned about in this class.

* Also, `Neural Networks` are fascinating!

And now for your enjoyment, I thought I'd leave you with one last laugh!
