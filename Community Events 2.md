- On Friday November 4th Kam Woods and Cal Lee hosted a Workshop to introduce people to BitCurator
<br>
- We went over some of the background of BitCurator and then got a hands on approach to play with BitCurator <br>
- There were probably around 15 people who were there, from all different backgrounds to learn about BitCurator 
<br>

Here I have the link to the full slideshow that Cal and Kam referred to for the event.

<h3> <strong> History </strong> </h3>
Cal went over the need for digital forensics and the purpose <br>

<blockquote div align="left"> Often archivists will get whole drives and told to keep what we can <br>
 We want to create a perfect copy of the data on the drive without changing it at all. So we take a disk image <br>
 Digital Forensics is to preserve authenticity, ensure integrity of materials <br>
 It also helps to prevent inadvertent disclosure of sensitive data. <br>
 Linked to Arvchives `which is my field yo!` and is concerned with provenance and chain of custody </blockquote>

We also went over the history of BitCurator
<blockquote div align="left"> 
 They're administrated through the Educopia Institute <br>
 Funding is based on membership dues <br>
 Memberships are the number 1 way to ensure the software will persist <br>
 You can view the membership details <a href="http://www.bitcurator.net/bitcurator-consortium/">here</a> if you'd like <br>
<br> </blockquote>

<h3> <strong> Examples </strong> </h3>
- Next they showed us some examples of some Different things that Bit Curator can do <br>
<blockquote div align="left">
We went over some of the file types you will most likely encounter, and how we process them  <br>
We briefly went over Hex Dumps and when you would need to work with them <br>
In BitCurator you can run checksums on your bitstreams, and create hashes to determine if bits have been changed after a transfer <br>
</blockquote>

- Next we went over Disk Image Formatting
<blockquote div align="left">
 E01 is a Disk Image Format and is used in BitCurator to view the metadata of the RAW files<br>
 For aquisition of a disk image, we used Guymager (which is a free version of FDK Imager) <br>
</blockquote>

- When we run BitCurator the software can present us with a number of things:
<blockquote div align="left">
- Reports of technical metadata <br>
- File Format Table <br>
- A Bulk Extractor Report to tell you the location of the information on the disk<br>
- Overview of File System Characteristics <br>
- A Premis.xml to show PREMIS preservation metadata <br>
All of these are incredibly important for Digital Archives! 
</blockquote>
<h3> <strong> Hands On </strong> </h3>
- Next we put the Information and Examples into action! 
- For the `Hands On` portion, we first downloaded a sample disk image online <br>
- We were running BitCurator on a remote system, Virtual Box, which puts us in a Linux environment

> It was my first time on a linux environment so I was pretty excited!

- We then went through our sample disk images and analyzed the information that was there with the BitCurator tools <br>

> You can use the BitCurator GUI or you can run these commands, and more on the Command Line, we used a combination of both

- Kam and Cal showed us how to run the different reports and how to read the important information we're looking for on the disk image <br>
- We went through each report and the files it combed through to show where and how it grabbed the information. 
- We also ran some checksums to show how and if the transitions changed the data, and how.

> I tried to take some screen shots of the hands-on stuff, but my computer wouldn't comply. <br>
> I think it's because we were using the Virtual Box remote access tool to run BitCurator. <br>
> But the Hands-On stuff was a lot cooler than what I can describe here!! <br>

<br>

<h3> <strong> End and Review </strong> </h3>
<li> We ended the class with talking about different applications for the software.<br> 
<li> Overall I thought this was an endlessly fascinating program and subject to explore <br>
<li> I do wish I was able to get some screen shots though! <br>
<li> I know I've only scratched the surface here, but there's so much information involved with this subject! <br>
<li> I will definitely be looking into this in the future, in fact I'm taking the Digital Forensics Class next Semester! <br> </li>


Also, we got pens, so you know it's pretty official <br>
