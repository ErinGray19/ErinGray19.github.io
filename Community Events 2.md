- On Friday November 4th Kam Woods and Cal Lee hosted a Workshop to introduce people to BitCurator
<br>
- We went over some of the background of BitCurator and then got a hands on approach to play with BitCurator <br>
- There were probably around 15 people who were there, from all different backgrounds to learn about BitCurator 
<br>
<br>
Here I have the link to the full slideshow that Cal and Kam referred to for the event.

<h3> <strong> History </strong> </h3>
Cal went over the need for digital forensics and the purpose <br>

<blockquote div align="left"> Often archivists will get whole drives and told to keep what we can <br>
 We want to create a perfect copy of the data on the drive without changing it at all. So we take a disk image <br>
 Digital Forensics is to preserve authenticity, ensure integrity of materials <br>
 It also helps to prevent inadvertent disclosure of sensitive data. <br>
 Linked to Arvchives `which is my field yo!` and is concerned with provenance and chain of custody </blockquote>

We also went over the history of BitCurator
