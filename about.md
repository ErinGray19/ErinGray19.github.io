Welcome to my About Me Page! 
To be honest, this whole coding thing is still incredibly new to me, and still pretty intimidating, but this class is giving me more confidence every day! 

I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to put in this post, so I thought I'd talk about the subject I know the most about,  **ME**

I got my undergraduate degree in Pscyhology from Appalachian State University ![alt text](https://mgtvsportzedge.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/app-st.gif)

I have a few obsessions: 

- Pizza ![pizza logo](http://slice.seriouseats.com/images/20110419-corner-slice-8th-and-31st-1.jpg)

- Mythology

- Game of Thrones ![got logo](http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GoT.png)

I hope you enjoyed my post, and I'm excited to learn more!
