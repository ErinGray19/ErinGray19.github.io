<li> On Wed Sept 28th a group of about 50 or so women gathered in Sitterson Hall to listen as Marina Kashgarian encouraged and taught us about some ways to get started in the field of Computer Science. </li>
<br>
<li> We went through a couple of simple coding tutorials, and took away some easy to use information and skills that can be used to help people think in different ways to get you in the mindset needed for coding. </li>

First, we started off with a great website that I have displayed below here called  <strong> Scratch.com </strong>
<div style="background-color:blue;color:white;padding:10px;">
if you click the green flag he does some fun stuff!

<p><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu" target="iframe_a">Scratch</a></p>

This site is for beginners and is used to show the thought processes behind building code (specifically Java) and getting your code to do the things you want. <br>
<br>
We used the controls to choose characters to interact with, change the background, made the characters move, and ultimately we created our own pong game! <br>
<br>
This site sets up the code to fit together like puzzle pieces, so that they only go together in a certain, logical way. <br>
<br>
I for one plan to use this site to build my skills for the future!! <br>
<br>
<li> We then moved on to <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> which is set up with different logic puzzles that you need to solve with java, which we did thorugh this site <a href="https://www.compilejava.net/">Compile Java </a></li>
(which was broken as of earlier today, so I found another online java site! )

Overall, I thought this was a pretty great experience. I will definitely be using these tools to explore and build my future IT skills!
