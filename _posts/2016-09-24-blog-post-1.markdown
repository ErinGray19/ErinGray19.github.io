<center><p><strong> Welcome to my first blog post!</strong></p></center>
 
<center><h2> This blog post will focus on some of the key things we've learned in class so far </h2></center><br>

<center><h3> Introduction </h3></center> <br>

- We're using Cloud9 to write code in plain text <br>
- And Github to publish our webpages <br>
```Using Github allows us to use Version Control as a way to track changes``` <br>

- We're using Markdown as our language because it is easy to use and easy to write <br>
- [This page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a great guide some some Markdown tips and helped me write this page!

<center><h3> Commands </h3></center> <br>
To get around the Command Line, it is helpful to know some of the commands used!
- For getting around in Directories, you'll need to know <br>
**`cd`** `change directory` <br>
**`pwd`** `show current directory` <br>
**`ls`** `list files` <br>

- With using Github, we can use other commands as well, Here's a few I use all of the time. <br>
**`git log`** `shows past commits` <br>
**`git add __`** `adds changes to list to be committed` <br>
**`git commit -m`** `commits chnages to the master branch, and add message` <br>
**`git push`** `pushes changes to your website` <br>
**`git status`** `lists files that have been changed but not committed` <br>
**`git init`** `create new local repository` <br>
- You can find more Linux Commands [here](https://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/) <br>
- There's also a ton more Git Commands some of which are [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html) <br> 

<center><h3> Forking and Cloning In Github </h3></center> <br>
- For forking I thought it might be fun to show this easy to follow video <br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5grYMXbAV0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>

- Cloning is similar to forking, in that we're finding a repository from someone else and making edits
- But with a clone, we don't need to worry about pushing the changes to the creator
- Instead it exists in our repositories as if we created it!
- To creat a clone, you will get the url from Github like here
- ![clone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silshack/inls161fall2016/gh-pages/assets/ref-images/clone.png)<br> 
- Then you will clone to your Cloud9 terminal with the command <br>
 `git clone copiedurl`
- From here you can `cd` into your new repository and explore and change things!

<center><h3> CSS Changes </h3></center> <br>
- Within your Cloud9 terminal you can change the style of your page by accessing the file, style.css<br>
- Within this file you can change things like color, font, size, etc..<br>
- So far [this site](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) by w3schools has been my go to for all things CSS!<br>


<center><h3> Branching and Merging </h3></center> <br>
- Branching is a good way to work on code and test it out before you commit it to the master<br>
- To checkout a branch you can use: <br> 
- `git checkout -b testing` this code creates a new branch and switches you into it. <br> 
- While in this new branch we can make changes that aren't committed to our website until we merge the testing branch and the master branch. <br> 

- To merge your branch back into your master (after all of your changes are saved, of course!), you'll `git checkout master` and be greeted by your old version of your site
- You will then `git merge testing` to merge your testing commits into the master!

<center><strong> This has been a rundown of the things we've been learning in class so far.<br> 
I will try to add more posts whenever more things are learned!
