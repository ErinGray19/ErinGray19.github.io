<h3> <center> Document Conversion and Scripts 
This Blog Post will be on what I've done for Assignment 3  </center> </h3>

#### *Abstract of Written Work*

My Paper I chose to alter was a paper that I'd written for my Intro to Archives Class on 
a patent letter that went missing from the National Archives for almost 40 years. 
This was the incredibly important pantent submission from 1903 from Orville and 
Wilbur Wright. The iconic patent documents, complete with sketches were discovered 
missing in the year 2000, and after targeted searches by specialy designated teams, 
was rediscovered earlier this year. I use this paper to explore the implications
of losing archival records on the whole of the archival world.


#### *Text Conversion*

- At first my script included 4 different pandoc scripts that I'd taken from one of our class assignments, and it looked like this: 

> pandoc -S -o WrightBrothersPatent.html WrightBrothersPatent.md <br>
> pandoc -S -o WrightBrothersPatent.docx WrightBrothersPatent.md <br>
> pandoc -S -o WrightBrothersPatent.odt WrightBrothersPatent.md <br>
> pandoc -S -o WrightBrothersPatent.pdf WrightBrothersPatent.md <br>

- While this worked fine, I wanted to attempt a `for loop` since I noticed I was 
repeating the same steps over and over except for the end result text type. 

- To do this, I copied the example used in class to make the colorful "Happy Birthday Text" since I also wanted to play around with the colors! 

<img src="/Gravity/image-1.png" alt="Happy Birthday" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

![Happy Birthday](/image-1.png?raw=true)

- After I looked over the for loop for a while I could start to decipher what was being called and when and was able to adjust the different elements to relect what I needed to change for my colors to show.
