<h3> <center> Document Conversion and Scripts 
This Blog Post will be on what I've done for Assignment 3  </center> </h3>

#### *Abstract of Written Work*

My Paper I chose to alter was a paper that I'd written for my Intro to Archives Class on 
a patent letter that went missing from the National Archives for almost 40 years. 
This was the incredibly important pantent submission from 1903 from Orville and 
Wilbur Wright. The iconic patent documents, complete with sketches were discovered 
missing in the year 2000, and after targeted searches by specialy designated teams, 
was rediscovered earlier this year. I use this paper to explore the implications
of losing archival records on the whole of the archival world.


#### *Text Conversion*

- At first my script included 4 different pandoc scripts that I'd taken from one of our class assignments, and it looked like this: 

> pandoc -S -o WrightBrothersPatent.html WrightBrothersPatent.md <br>
> pandoc -S -o WrightBrothersPatent.docx WrightBrothersPatent.md <br>
> pandoc -S -o WrightBrothersPatent.odt WrightBrothersPatent.md <br>
> pandoc -S -o WrightBrothersPatent.pdf WrightBrothersPatent.md <br>

- I took the setup and replaced my file name, and had it convert to the files I needed.
- While this worked fine, I wanted to attempt a `for loop` since I noticed I was 
repeating the same steps over and over except for the end result text type. 

- To do this, I copied the example used in class to make the colorful "Happy Birthday Text" since I also wanted to play around with the colors!

- After I looked over the for loop for a while I could start to decipher what was being called and when, and was able to adjust the different elements to relect what I needed to change for my colors to show.
- I ended up able to change my readout to show the file types created in different colors as shown here:

- I also found a function that tells you the date when you run your script and I loved it. 
- I had to google a few times before I could make it work, but I thought it was really cool.

#### *Reflections and "AHA" moments*

- I had so many "AHA" moments doing this and was admittedly unsure about a lot of what I was doing, but I think it came out alright.

- When I was attempting the `for loop` I ran into a few issues with the colors 
- The first time I ran the script for the `for loop` to list out each file created with the file type in different colors, I ended up changing the colors for everything until the next color change
- After looking at the [colors page](http://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting) again I noticed there's this fun sequence that removes the color correction!

> `\e[0m` helpfully kills all that pesky color correction!!! <br>
> This was probably the highlight to the whole project

- When I made it to the `date function` I first used a function from the [linux command shell script](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_wss0020.php) and it didn't work.
- I'm still not sure *exactly* why it didnt work, but I consulted a few other sites (via Google) and was able to find a [forum](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1401482/yyyy-mm-dd-format-date-in-shell-script)
with some other options that I was able to opt in, and it worked!! 

- I feel like I've learned a lot on this assignment from branching out and doing stuff on my own, also the other people in class have been really helpful during our project work time in class!
- I'm feeling pretty good about my work this time, please let me know if there's anything I need to modify!
